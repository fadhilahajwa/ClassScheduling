# Introduction

CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains inactive, the operating system will select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution which will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. There are two types of CPU scheduling which are pre-emptive and non pre-emptive. As for this project, we focus on non pre-emptive scheduling. 

# Consideration

There are various types of scheduling which are FCFS, Round-Robin, SJF, SRTF, or Priority Scheduling. For this project, we have propose to compare three types of scheduling algorithms which are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest-Job First (SJF) and Priority Scheduling. For the data input, we have the arrival time, burst time and priority and we need to find the average waiting time and average turn around time.

# Analysis

Inputs for the project:

Course code: CSC 3102 <br>
Duration: 2 <br>
Priority: 3 <br>
Arrival Time: 1

Course Code: INFO 3501<br>
Duration: 1 <br>
Priority: 4 <br>
Arrival Time: 2

Course Code: CSC 3402 <br>
Duration: 3 <br>
Priority: 1 <br>
Arrival Time: 3

Course Code: INFO 3305 <br>
Duration: 4 <br>
Priority: 2 <br>
Arrival Time: 4

## FCFS

Output

Average waiting time = 3.25
Average turn around time = 5.75

## SJF

Output

Average waiting time = 1.75
Average turn around time = 5.25

## Priority Scheduling

Output

Average waiting time = 3.25
Average turn around time = 5.75
