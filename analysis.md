# Introduction

CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair. There are two types of CPU scheduling which are pre-emptive and non pre-emptive. As for this project, we focus on non pre-emptive scheduling. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.

# Consideration

For this project, we have propose to compare three types of scheduling which are FCFS, SJP and priority scheduling.
